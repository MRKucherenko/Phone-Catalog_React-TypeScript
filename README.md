# ⚡ Tech Catalog — Smart, Smooth & Stylish


## Hey there! 👋
- Welcome to **Tech Catalog**, my modern **React + TypeScript** web application built with Class Components and inspired by the **Phone Catalog V2 Figma design**.
- It’s a sleek, multi-page and responsive catalog where you can explore a wide range of tech products — from **smartphones** and **tablets** to **smartwatches** and more.

- Everything is designed to feel **fast**, **intuitive**, and **smooth** — with clean **UI**, **pagination**, **filters**, **favorites**, and a **shopping cart** that remembers your selections. 💫
